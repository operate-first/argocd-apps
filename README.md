# Operate-first ArgoCD application manifests
A repository to store Operate-First ArgoCD Applications.  This repository's primary purpose is to enable the [App of Apps Pattern](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/#app-of-apps-pattern). This means that we can create an ArgoCD application that can be pointed to this repo and deploy various other ArgoCD applications.

For ArgoCD access, please check out our onboarding docs [here](https://github.com/operate-first/support/tree/main/docs).

ArgoCD can be accessed [here](https://argocd-server-argocd.apps.cnv.massopen.cloud/applications).
